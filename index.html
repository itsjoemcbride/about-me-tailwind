          Pictured below is my desk, when I moved I replaced my monitors with
          two 27" 165Hz 1440p IPS displays, and my keyboard is a foam modded
          RK68 keyboard with GMK Geoma Keycaps. The mouse I use at this desk is
          a Logitech G305 <i>LIGHTSPEED</i>.

          Inside my PC is a little more interesting. I decided to completely
          upgrade my system during the summer of 2020 during lockdown, as at the
          time I was still using an AMD Athlon processor, and DDR3 RAM. <br />
          My current specs are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>CPU</b> Ryzen 7 3700X</li>
          <li><b>GPU</b> Nvidia RTX 2070 Super</li>
          <li><b>RAM</b> 16GB DDR4</li>
          <li><b>CASE</b> NZXT H510 Elite</li>
        </ul>
